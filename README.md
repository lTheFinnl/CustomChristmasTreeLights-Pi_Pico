# CustomChristmasTreeLights-Pi_Pico
Makes use of indivisually addressable WS2811 lights to create custom light shows on a Christmas tree. Includes a variety of commands for changing the LEDs in bulk or singularly.

Check out the wiki for instructions!

The Python file in this repository contains the "coordinates" of the lights on my tree, and will likely need to be adjusted if you are to try this yourself.

My first somewhat major Python project.
